Collecting data, on switches to be sent with gmail on the cell phone

# Purpose for app?
A friend, hated writing her work in her book and manually typing it all out and sending the email, and checking her emails to check what was the details of the switch and ip addresses. For this reason she asked me to do this and I though ok.

# Technical details about app
Most important feature, is the sending of data, I used my own gmail account. I used the api. but the only problem was my gmail security becomes low. Such as you would need to give your gmail account the permission that any application can connect to your account, which I do not agree with. 

As an alternative. what i did was use the gmail on the android device itself. Reason for this choice is. You will need ur gmail account on an android device.. and the only parameters needed is the subject,email list and body of the email. This will then bring up your gmail account. The only thing you would need to do is click send
